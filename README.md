# ColorBot
Discord-Bot that allows the users to color their names. Can be used for self-roles and other things as well

This Bot comes with various features. Including a Database, custom Prefix and many whitelists.

The Prefixes for the Bot that are always active are: !color, !c.
In addition, you can add a third prefix for the current guild.

For more Information on how to use the Bot take a look at the help menu.

To setup this Bot, you will need to do a few things:

1. I recommend you to set a custom-prefix as some Bots may have the same prefixes as ColorBot.

    This is done via the set-prefix command.
  
2. Next you want to set a position for the roles to be created under.

    For this, you use the set-role-position command.
  
3. You may also only want specific roles to be able to use the create command.

    This is achieved via the create-whitelist command.
  
4. To set a limit on how many roles each user can create/have, please use this command:

    role-amount
  
5. There also is a way to make every role on the server transparent. This can be used to have ColorRoles created at the bottom of the role-list.

    To achieve this, you would use the transparent-all command.
  
6. There are also filters on which words can´t be used in the name of roles created via the create command:

    To add words to this filter, simply use the blacklist-words command.
    The whitelist-words command removes words from the whitelist.
  
7. You may not want that users can assign themself roles others created.

    For this you just use the auto-whitelist command.
  
8. If you wish to add roles that the users can assign themselves, just use the following command:

    whitelist


Detailed information on how to use the commands, more commands available and the syntax of the commands can be found in the help menu.
